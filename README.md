In this report, we have analysed the relationship between World Development Indicator and Covid-19 death rate. We have done clustering using K-means clustering algorithm by which we make 6 clusters, equals to number of  continents. We use logistic regression for binary classification to foresee high COVID causalities and get 100% accuracy. For multi class classification we use two more algorithms i.e. Linear Discriminant Analysis and  Quadratic discriminant analysis along with Logistic Regression and then compare their results, LDA gives  highest accuracy of 89.3% among all three of them.
